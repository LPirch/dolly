# Dolly: Code Clone Detection using LLMs and GNNs

<img src="media/dolly-logo.jpeg" alt="Dolly Logo" width="200" height="200">

Dolly is an advanced code clone detection system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify similar code patterns across codebases. This project is part of a tutorial at the BIFOLD Tutorial Day (2025, TU Berlin).

## Overview

Code clone detection is a crucial task in software engineering, helping developers identify duplicated code, potential bugs, and opportunities for refactoring. We focus on software vulnerabilities and showcase how graph-based learning with PyTorch Geometric can be implemented for this task. Also, we include an approach based on LLMs for comparison.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

The instructions for the setup are not yet complete and will be pushed until April 29th.
